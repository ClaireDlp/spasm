There are several BFS in the code (in the DM/CC part, and to find pivots). Not DRY. Factorize.

refactor spasm_save_scr spasm_save_triplet, spasm_free_LU;

refactor the whole DM mess

SCC should use Tarjan's or Dijkstra's algorithm instead of Kosaraju's. It would remove the need to transpose and be 2x faster.

Markowitz pivoting to find many good pivots.

spasm_PLUQ should return PLUQ == A (incorporate the row_permutation into P).

bench/rank_hybrid should automatically transpose its input.
